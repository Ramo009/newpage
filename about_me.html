      My Journey from Programming to Cybersecurity: Discovering Website
      Vulnerabilities and Ethical Hacking</em
    >
  </span>
  <p class="description">
    Hi, my name is Ramazan, and my programming journey began a while back.
     I started with the basics of web development, learning HTML, CSS,
      and  JavaScript, which I consistently studied for some time.
       During that period, I also worked part-time, balancing my learning with other commitments.
        However, due to some unforeseen personal challenges, I had to take a break.
         Eventually, I made a fresh start and shifted my focus beyond frontend development.
          I explored Linux, ethical hacking, Python programming, and website vulnerability discovery.
           This exploration ignited my passion for cybersecurity, where 
           I began developing skills in identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening online defenses.
            These new areas have allowed me to gain deeper knowledge in security and automation,
             opening new doors in the tech world. During this time, I also improved my German and English 
    language skills, which has enhanced my communication and collaboration capabilities.
