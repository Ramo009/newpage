                <!-- to my opinion, the best way to start with a programming language is to learn the basics first, then gradually move on to more complex topics. Practice is key! -->
                To start with programming, focus on mastering the basics first.
                Understand fundamental concepts like variables, control
                structures, and data types. Then, gradually explore more complex
                topics such as algorithms and data structures. Consistent
                practice is essential for building your skills. Engage in
                hands-on projects, solve coding challenges, and collaborate with
                others to enhance your learning experience. Remember, the
                journey of programming is continuous, so keep exploring and
                experimenting with new ideas.

                <!-- and learning now mongoDB -->
                My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, basic Linux tools like
                Wireshark, information security, and Node.js. I am currently
                learning MongoDB. I have experience in web development, data
                analysis. I am always eager to learn new technologies and
                improve my skills. I enjoy problem-solving and have a strong
                foundation in algorithms and data structures. My goal is to
                create efficient and user-friendly applications that solve
                real-world problems. I am passionate about coding and enjoy
                working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and
                critically.

                <!-- I have worked in a lot of projects, but they was was like test or challenge by my self and  i didnt worked on real projects, including web applications, data analysis tools, and machine learning models. -->
                I have learned a lot from my projects, but they were mostly
                tests or challenges that I set for myself. I have not yet worked
                on real-world projects. These experiences have helped me apply
                my skills and gain practical knowledge in software development.
                I enjoy collaborating with others and contributing to
                open-source projects. My portfolio highlights some of my work,
                and I am always seeking new challenges to overcome.
